Keep all code modular. Avoid defining functions inside page components unless absolutely necessaryâ€”extract to separate files for reuse. If unsure, ask first.

---

Prefer files under 200 lines. If it exceeds that, ask whether parts can be extracted into shared functions or components.

---

Follow best practices for clean, maintainable code.

Never use low-contrast text. All textâ€”including titles, text, placeholders, dropdowns, labels, and buttonsâ€”must be clearly readable against its background at all times. If unsure, increase contrast or ask.

All text in the app must be in Swedish.

---

Always ask a clarifying question in your response before you start coding or acting, even if the instructions seem clear.
